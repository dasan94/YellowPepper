- **RestAssured**: For API testing and interacting with REST services
- **JUnit**: For running the test cases
- **Maven**: For managing dependencies and build automation

## Features

### How to Add New Test Scenarios
#### Add the feature scenario: Create a new feature file or update existing ones in src/test/resources/features.
#### Define the steps: Implement step definitions by updating or creating new classes in src/main/java/org/example/steps.
#### Run the tests: Execute the tests to validate your new scenarios.

Scenario: Add a new pet to the inventory
  Given I have a pet with the following details
    | id     | name  | status   |
    | 12345  | Rex   | available|
  When I send a POST request to add the pet
  Then the status code is 200
  And the response contains the name "Rex"
```
